<p class="govuk-body">
  This pattern helps users view a linear record of what’s happened.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="when-to-use">When to use</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">Use the Timeline pattern to show information that is ordered by time to let users know about the history of an item, such as a case or payment.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="when-to-use">When not to use</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">Do not use the timeline pattern if you need to let users know where they are in a journey. In this case, consider another approach. </p>
<p class="govuk-body">The timeline should not mix past and future events. If you need to show both past and future events, show them as separate timelines or use an alternative design.<p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">Each item in the timeline should have:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet" role="list">
  <li> a title</li>
  <li>date or time</li>
  <li>description (optional)</li>
</ul>

  You need HMRC Frontend to use this pattern – <a class="govuk-link" href="/hmrc-design-patterns/install-hmrc-frontend-in-your-prototype/">find out how to install HMRC Frontend</a>. If you use the HMRC Nunjucks macro, you must copy and paste the entire macro in to your code.

<h2 id="research" class="govuk-heading-l">Research</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">The pattern is used in the VAT repayments service and was tested with 7 users across 3 rounds.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Research has shown that users:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet" role="list">
  <li> understood that events were connected to one another on a timeline, with one event following another </li>
  <li> easily identified that the top event was the most recent;</li>
  <li>on smaller screens had a similar experience to those on larger devices</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">We need more research. If you have used the Timeline pattern, get in touch to share your research findings.</p>
